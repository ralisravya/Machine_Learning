Neural networks are almost never trained/run one input at a time; we usually feed them several inputs together (a mini-batch).

    "As before, we have given you hopefully just enough to get you started, but there is much more to learn. This means that once you start trying things, you will almost certainly get stuck. Feel free to ask questions on the discussion board, we'll do our best to help. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some recommendations:\n",
    "* Plot your [loss curves](). We recommend using Tensorboard to monitor your training, which integrates well with Keras.\n",
    "* The most important hyperparameters to tweak are probably _batch size_, _learning rate_ and _number of hidden units_.\n",
    "* It's likely that at some point [your loss function will suddenly become NaN](http://russellsstewart.com/notes/0.html) (not a number). This often happens when one of the units somewhere in your network gets very big (close to infinite). This causes the loss to become infinite for, which gives NaN for the gradient. Keras still continues with the backpropagation, and the whole network becomes NaN. Usually, it help to reduce the learning rate or to increase the number of hidden units. If not, you should train your model one batch at a time by calling model.train_on_batch(), printing the weights after each batch. This allows you to see what happens just before the loss becomes NaN, which may give you a hint as to what is happening.\n",
    "* As you can see, even training a medium-size network can take a long time, especially if you don't have access to a GPU. One trick you can try is [transfer learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/transfer-learning-using-keras-d804b2e04ef8). Using a model that somebody else has trained, and building on top of it. This allows you to use the power of a deep network, while only training a few layers yourself. The VGG network, which Keras can download for you, is a particularly good choice.\n",
    "* If you want to compare Keras models against other classifiers or regression methods, Keras [integrates with sklearn](https://keras.io/scikit-learn-api/).\n",
    "* For modest networks, you should be able to just let your laptop run overnight to perform experiments. If you want a little more power, you'll need a GPU.\n",
    " * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is a cloud-based notebook environment based on Jupyter. It's easy to request a GPU and run your notebook based experiments in there,\n",
    " * Google Cloud Compute has [a 300$ free tier](https://hackernoon.com/launch-a-gpu-backed-google-compute-engine-instance-and-setup-tensorflow-keras-and-jupyter-902369ed5272), that should be enough to run experiments for this course (especially if everybody n your group signs up). Making mistakes in cloud computing can be costly, so be sure to do the following:\n",
    " * Make sure the machine turns off after each experiment.\n",
    " * Set up budget limits and alerts so you realize quickly if you're running our of credit.\n",
    " * Keep your private key and signup email _extremely_ private. If, for instance, you accidentally put this on github, it will get crawled almost immediately and someone will set up a bitcoin miner on your credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some good resources to read first:\n",
    "* [37 reasons why your neural network is not working](https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607)\n",

    "* [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) A famous Stanford course on computer vision with deep neural networks. The level is a little higher than our course, but they also deal with the practicalities of deep learning a lot better.\n",
